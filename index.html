            <p>The Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare (CMPH) in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London is part of a multi-university collaboration funded by the Nuffield Foundation to examine the impacts of technological disruption on people and communities across the UK and to ascertain the future of working practices and job skills in the UK.</p>
            <p>This £1.8M project (The ‘Pissarides Review’) is a 3-year collaboration between the London School of Economics, the Institute for the Future of Work (IFOW), Imperial College London and Warwick Business School, supported by the Nuffield Foundation and in collaboration also with economists at UCL. Grounded in the Nobel Prize Winning research of Principal Investigator Professor Chris Pissarides on frictions, the project involves a cross-disciplinary approach to evaluating disruption and modelling competing futures for work. The overarching purpose of the project is to help build a future of better work for the UK with a focus on building capabilities, strengthening resilience and reducing inequalities through better work.</p>

            <h3>Examining the changing skills requirements of the UK labour market</h3>
            <p>New technologies are changing the skills employers require of their workers. We use job postings data to investigate how skills are related to one another and how demand for skills is changing across occupations and regions of the UK.</p>
            <h3>Exploring regional variation in technological transformation</h3>
            <p>Through the Disruption Index, we examine how technological transformation may already be affecting parts of England differently, and how ready these regions are to adopt further new technologies in the years to come.</p>
            <h3>Studying the impact of new technologies on the wellbeing of workers</h3>
            <p>The introduction of new technologies across the labour market has the potential to fundamentally change relationships workers have with their jobs. In turn, this may have positive or negative effects on how satisfied workers are with their job, and their lives as a whole. We study how these changes to work may influence the wellbeing of workers.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03139">Patterns of co-occurrent skills in UK job adverts</a></h3>
            <p><i>Zhaolu Liu, Jonathan Clarke, Bertha Rohenkohl, Mauricio Barahona</i></p>
            <p>A job usually involves the application of several complementary or synergistic skills to perform its required tasks. Such relationships are implicitly recognised by employers in the skills they demand when recruiting new employees. Here we construct a skills network based on their co-occurrence in a national level data set of 65 million job postings from the UK spanning 2016 to 2022. We then apply multiscale graph-based community detection to obtain data-driven skill clusters at different levels of resolution that reveal a modular structure across scales. Skill clusters display diverse levels of demand and occupy varying roles within the skills network: some have broad reach across the network (high closeness centrality) while others have higher levels of within-cluster containment, yet with high interconnection across clusters and no skill silos. The skill clusters also display varying levels of semantic similarity, highlighting the difference between co-occurrence in adverts and intrinsic thematic consistency. Clear geographic variation is evident in the demand for each skill cluster across the UK, broadly reflecting the industrial characteristics of each region, e.g., London appears as an outlier as an international hub for finance, education and business. Comparison of data from 2016 and 2022 reveals employers are demanding a broader range of skills over time, with more adverts featuring skills spanning different clusters. We also show that our data-driven clusters differ from expert-authored categorisations of skills, indicating that important relationships between skills are not captured by expert assessment alone.</p>

            <p><i>Rui Costa, Zhaolu Liu, Christopher Pissarides, Bertha Rohenkohl</i></p>
            <p>In this report, we use a comprehensive dataset of online job postings from Adzuna, which provides information on the type of positions advertised and the skills that they require. We find rapid emergence of new skills and the disappearance of other, old skills. Notably, most skills becoming obsolete and new ones emerging to take their place, are related to IT. We quantify the magnitude and pace of skill change and find that it varies considerably across occupations. Occupations like IT directors, production engineers and cybersecurity professionals have experienced a high turnover of skill requirements, in contrast to slower-changing occupations, such as teaching, carpentry and several elementary trades.</p>

            <p><i>Jiyuan Zheng, Bertha Rohenkohl, Mauricio Barahona, Jonathan M Clarke</i></p>
            <p>The personal well-being of workers may be influenced by the risk of job automation brought about by technological innovation. Here we use data from the Understanding Society survey in the UK and a fixed-effects model to examine associations between working in a highly automatable job and life and job satisfaction. We find that employees in highly automatable jobs report significantly lower job satisfaction, a result that holds across demographic groups categorised by gender, age and education, with higher negative association among men, higher degree holders and younger workers. On the other hand, life satisfaction of workers is not generally associated with the risk of job automation, a result that persists among groups disaggregated by gender and education, but with age differences, since the life satisfaction of workers aged 30 to 49 is negatively associated with job automation risk. Our analysis also reveals differences in these associations across UK industries and regions.</p>

            <p><i>Bertha Rohenkohl and Jonathan M Clarke</i></p>
            <p>Automation technologies are reshaping work, which has complex impacts on the wellbeing of workers. In this paper we review the literature on the impact of automation technologies on subjective wellbeing. We explore automation risk, the expectations of automation and technology adoption, and analyse their effects on job and life satisfaction. While negative consequences of automation are commonly studied, our review uncovers potential for both positive and negative effects on wellbeing.</p>
